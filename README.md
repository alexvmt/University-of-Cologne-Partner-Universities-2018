## University of Cologne Partner Universities 2018 EDA

#### Overview
1. Introduction
2. Imports and setup
3. Scraping and wrangling the data
4. Exploratory data analysis
5. Geographical visualization

In this small project I scrape the partner universities of the University of Cologne's Faculty of Management, Economics and Social Sciences as of August 2018. I also perform a short exploratory data analysis and create some visualizations.

See the current list of partner universities here: https://www.international.wiso.uni-koeln.de/de/international-profile/partner-universities/

*Note: Since the URL has changed since the first creation of this notebook, there have been a couple of issues with retrieving the data correctly. I could already fix most issues, but a couple of European universities are currently missing in the analysis since they couldn't be extracted using the original code. I'll fix this issue asap.*
